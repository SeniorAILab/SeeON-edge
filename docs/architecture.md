# Architecture

The worker is one process that turns RTSP frames into business events. It is
organised as five layers with one direction of flow, a single canonical
entrypoint, and an explicit rule about which envelopes may carry pixels. This
document is the decision record for that shape: what each layer owns, what state
is per camera, what happens on each class of failure, and which legacy module
became which worker module.

Read the scoped `AGENTS.md` next to the code you are changing for the
per-package import ceiling. Boundaries are enforced by import-linter
(`uv run --group lint lint-imports`), not by convention.

The runtime slot produces media and sends delivery records to the backend. The
backend owns metadata, database access, and media access. The frontend consumes
only the backend HTTP API.

## Co-located persistence boundary

The one supported edge deployment is one local Linux host, one Compose release
unit, one API process, and one worker process. Those processes remain
import-independent and HTTP remains their command/event notification boundary.
The backend alone opens PostgreSQL. The `postgres` compose service holds the
only durable store; the worker slot has no database credentials and never
opens, migrates, or repairs the database.

### PostgreSQL schemas and provisioning

The backend connects through `open_postgres_root`
(`backend/app/postgres_root.py`). Three environment values, set in
`compose.edge.yaml`, name what it needs: `API_POSTGRES_DSN_FILE` (connection
string file), `API_POSTGRES_AUTHORITY_FILE` (persistence authority file), and
`API_POSTGRES_SCHEMA` (default `seeon_edge`). The DDL lives in
`backend/app/edge_db/postgres_product.sql` (ten product tables, including
`schema_migrations`), `postgres_delivery.sql` (`deployment_authority` and the
four event-delivery tables), and `postgres_diagnostics.sql` (the six
`execution_*` record tables).

Only the one-shot `edge-db-migrator` compose service, which runs
`python -m backend.app.edge_db.migration provision`, creates the schemas, the
runtime role, and the authority row, before `ml-api` starts. The runtime never
executes DDL.

| Schema | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `<API_POSTGRES_SCHEMA>` (default `seeon_edge`) | product tables and event delivery |
| `<API_POSTGRES_SCHEMA>_diagnostics` (default `seeon_edge_diagnostics`) | execution-record telemetry |

Execution-record telemetry (the six `execution_*` tables) is written on every
worker flush (~250 ms) and pruned toward its retention budget on that same hot
path. It lives in its own schema so that write load stays apart from alerts,
incidents, and policy writes in the product schema.

### Authority fence

`deployment_authority` holds one row: `generation`, `writer_token`,
`accepting`, and `egress_enabled`. The backend reads its token from the
authority file, and every write transaction calls `require_authority`, which
locks the row `FOR SHARE` and refuses when the generation, token, or
`accepting` flag does not match. `freeze_authority` closes the fence, so a
runtime holding a stale token can no longer write.

### Connection budget

The backend pool is fixed by `DEFAULT_POOL_BUDGET`: at most 8 connections, 32
waiting requests, a 2 s acquire timeout, a 5000 ms statement timeout, a
3000 ms lock timeout, and a 10 s startup timeout. Transactions are short:
never hold one across hash, fsync, HTTP, or other external work.

### Retired SQLite file

The runtime does not read `edge.sqlite3` or `edge-diagnostics.sqlite3`. Only
`backend/app/edge_db/migration/` opens the retired `edge.sqlite3`, once, to
copy it into PostgreSQL through the `edge-db-cutover` compose service (ops
profile); import-linter contracts in `pyproject.toml` keep every other module
from importing `sqlite3`.

### Image rollback preserves the state

Rollback is binary-only and image-digest based. Pin the previous `@sha256:`
digests in `ML_API_IMAGE` / `ML_WORKER_IMAGE`, never a mutable tag, and restart
in the fixed order `edge-db-migrator` -> `ml-api` (healthy) -> `ml-worker`.
There is no in-process downgrade path. Never run `down -v`, never delete the
`edge-pgdata` volume, and never repair the database with direct SQL.

## Layers

Flow is one-way. A layer may depend on the layer above it and on
`worker/types` and `worker/interfaces`; it may never reach back down.

```

`worker/runtime/` is the composition root: it builds the layers, owns the
bootstrap gates, the GPU lease, the watchdog, and the fault handler. It is the
only package permitted to import everything.

## Types and the contracts boundary

Worker-internal ports and envelopes live under `worker/`; cross-instance L0 data
stays in `contracts`. `contracts/` is the ADR-0006 typed-vocabulary leaf and the
authority for it; the copy in the archived `eldercare-dataset-ops` is historical
only, and no test compares the two. Never edit anything under it as part of
worker work, and never duplicate or shadow a contract type inside `worker/`.

| Envelope | Module | Carries pixels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FramePacket` | `worker/types/frame_packet.py` | yes |
| `ModuleResult` | `worker/types/module_result.py` | no |
| `DecisionInput` | `worker/types/decision_input.py` | no |
| `BusinessEvent` | `worker/types/business_event.py` | no |

## Provider/consumer contract between backend and worker

`backend` and `worker` are deployed independently and never import each
other (import-linter keeps both directions forbidden). They still meet at two
runtime seams -- the ml-api proxies calling the worker's live-view server on
`ml-worker:8090` (stream, snapshot, pose overlay, bed-zone recognize, RTSP
probe), and the `clips/<clip_id>/manifest.json` the worker writes and ml-api
reads back.

The rule for both: **each side owns its own definition of the interface, and
a test -- not a shared module -- catches drift.** The provider owns the schema
it serves or writes; the consumer owns the schema it expects. `contracts/` is
the ADR-0006 ML vocabulary (this repository holds the authoritative copy; the
archived eldercare-dataset-ops copy is historical only), not an edge-internal
interface package, so neither seam is defined there.

| Seam | Provider (worker) | Consumer (backend) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:8090` HTTP | `worker/pipeline/output/live_view_api.py` -- route matchers, relay-token header, MJPEG media type, request/response bodies | `backend/app/features/cameras/streams_router.py`, `bed_zone_router.py`, `router.py` (probe) -- path builders and response parsers |
| `manifest.json` | `worker/pipeline/output/evidence/manifest_models.py` + `clip_manifest_payload.py` -- the fields the writer emits | `backend/app/features/clips/manifest.py` (lenient serving parser) |

`tests/test_backend_worker_runtime_contracts.py` is the drift guard and the
one sanctioned place that imports both packages: it publishes a manifest with
the worker writer, parses it with the backend serving parser and lists it
through the PostgreSQL clip catalogue, asserts every path
the backend builds is matched by the worker's route and by no other, and
round-trips each worker response body (probe, pose overlay, bed zone) through
the backend parser. A field either side adds must pass there before it ships.

### Live preview overlays

Preview overlay selection is camera-local: person and bed rendering are
independent toggles over the clean SDK frame. Person boxes and track IDs come
from SDK metadata; every persisted bed region is scaled from its recorded image
dimensions. The preview does not invent a region or run continuous bed
segmentation.

Bed recognition consumes a clean snapshot, never the annotated preview cache.
The non-saving recognize request accepts a confidence and returns multiple
candidate regions. The operator may edit polygons, then explicitly persists
them with `PUT /cameras/{id}/bed-zone`. The backend stores the canonical
`{regions, image_width, image_height, recognized_at}` value as compact JSON in
PostgreSQL and sends all regions to the worker; `regions: []` explicitly clears
the bed zone. The shared snapshot tiler/OSD/file bridge serializes requests
across cameras.
Operator preview selections do not disable overlays on alert-evidence JPEGs
and do not change the original Smart Record video bytes. Host tests cover
toggle routing and polygon pixels; actual SDK rendering still needs runtime
visual verification.

## Raw-image vs numeric fan-out

`FramePacket` is the only envelope permitted to carry an image. Four
subscribers may receive it, and no others:

| Subscriber | Why it needs pixels |
| --- | --- |
| Model extraction | runs the person/pose/bed-seg adapters |
| Derivative evidence | feeds the per-camera segment encoder for clips |
| Overlay / MJPEG live view | draws debug output for operators |
| Alert snapshot | encodes the single bounded JPEG attached to an alert |

Everything downstream of analytics is numeric.
`DecisionInput` carries exactly the seven fields `observation`, `frame_width`,
`frame_height`, `live_track_ids`, `time_sec`, `frame_index`, and `bed_region` —
no array, no buffer, no handle from which a frame could be recovered. A domain
detector that needs a pixel is a design error: add an extractor in layer 3 and
pass the number it produced.

## Per-camera state vs shared state

Anything temporal belongs to exactly one camera. Anything expensive and
stateless is built once per process. `tests/test_worker_per_camera_fall_state.py`
guards both halves.

| State | Scope | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SceneState | per camera | `worker/pipeline/perception/scene_state.py` |
| Window buffer and fall probabilities | per camera | `worker/pipeline/perception/window_buffer.py` |
| Fall latch | per camera | `worker/domains/fall/detector.py` |
| Bed assignments, grace/hold, night window | per camera | `worker/domains/bed_exit/` |
| IncidentManager | per camera | `worker/pipeline/decision/incident_manager.py` |
| Flow metadata slot and policy state | per camera | `worker/runtime/flow/metadata_slot.py`, `policy_pump.py` |
| Flow evidence state | per camera | `worker/runtime/flow/evidence.py` |
| Flow lifecycle supervision | shared, one per process | `worker/runtime/flow/lifecycle_supervisor.py` |
| Model objects and extractor instances | shared, one per task per process | `worker/runtime/model_composition.py` |
| Flow runtime descriptor | shared, one per process | `worker/runtime/profile/` |
| GPU lease | shared, one per process | `worker/runtime/lease.py` |
| Config / LKG store | shared, one per process | `worker/runtime/config/` |
| Evidence delivery queue | shared, one per process | `shared/events/delivery_queue.py` (`DeliveryQueue`), composed by `worker/pipeline/output/evidence/evidence_runtime.py` and `evidence_stager.py` |
| Clip store lock | shared, one per host directory | `worker/pipeline/output/evidence/clip_store_lock.py` |

Sharing a per-camera row across cameras is a correctness bug, not an
optimisation: it leaks one resident's motion history into another's fall
decision.

## Model artifacts

Model weights are a pinned external artifact owned by the worker side, never
part of an image and never a host bind mount. `worker/tools/fetch_models/
manifest.json` pins each file to an upstream revision (Hugging Face commit or
GitHub release tag), a byte size, and a SHA-256; the one-shot `edge-model-fetch`
compose service runs `python -m worker.tools.fetch_models` from the worker
image into the `worker-models` named volume before `ml-worker` starts, skips
files that already verify, and exits non-zero on any mismatch. `ml-worker`
mounts that volume read-only at `/app/models`; `ml-api` does not mount it at
all. `worker/tools/` is out-of-band operator tooling, not a worker entrypoint:
import-linter forbids every runtime layer from importing it, and the fetcher is
stdlib-only so it runs before torch or any adapter is loaded.

## Entrypoint

The canonical and only command is:

```sh
python -m worker
```

`worker/__main__.py` owns the CLI: it parses argv, loads config, constructs
`WorkerRuntime` directly, and maps outcomes to exit codes. `worker/runtime/worker.py`
stays composition-only and exports exactly three classes —
`CameraRuntimeContext`, `HeartbeatReporter`, `WorkerRuntime`. There is no
module-level `main` there and no delegate indirection; earlier drafts of this
document claimed one, and that claim was wrong. Do not add an alias module, a
console script, or a per-submodule `python -m` target: one entrypoint is a plan
requirement.

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | clean shutdown |
| 1 | generic runtime error |
| 2 | config or resolution error |
| 3 | refuse-to-start (a bootstrap gate failed) |
| 4 | fatal accelerator fault (`worker/runtime/faults/handler.py`, hard exit) |

## Failure matrix

Global faults kill the process loudly. Per-camera faults degrade exactly one
camera. There is no silent CPU or OpenCV fallback, and `auto` device selection
is a loud failure, per ADR-0002.

| Fault | Scope | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flow runtime configuration invalid | global | refuse to start, exit 3 |
| Model artifact missing or unloadable | global | refuse to start, exit 3 |
| Real warmup inference fails | global | refuse to start, exit 3 |
| GPU lease already held by another process | global | refuse to start, exit 3 |
| Config invalid and no LKG available | global | exit 2 |
| Config invalid but LKG present | global | run from LKG, report degraded status |
| Accelerator fault mid-run (device lost, unrecoverable) | global | record first fault, hard exit 4 for supervised restart |
| Inference deadline exceeded | global | watchdog records and escalates to the fault path |
| RTSP connect/auth failure | per camera | that camera retries with backoff; others unaffected |
| Decode stall or stream EOF | per camera | reopen the source; camera reports unhealthy meanwhile |
| Frame bus full | per camera | drop oldest, increment drop metric; never block ingest |
| Extractor raises on one frame | per camera | frame dropped, camera continues |
| Clip encode failure | per camera | alert still relays; evidence marked incomplete |
| Relay POST failure | per camera | durable outbox retries; no event is lost in memory |
| Clip store locked by another process | global | worker refuses to start: two workers must not share one outbox (ADR-0003) |
| Evidence delivery enabled but misconfigured or unable to initialise | global | worker refuses to start rather than run with alerts stranded in the local outbox (ADR-0003) |

Rollback of a bad worker image is image-digest based; see
[Image rollback preserves the state volume](#image-rollback-preserves-the-state-volume).

## Source-to-target ownership

Every non-`__init__` source file in the legacy tree has exactly one owner below.
These rows are historical citations of a migration, not operator instructions.
`tests/test_worker_architecture_docs.py`, which asserted that the map was
complete and unambiguous while the legacy tree existed, has been deleted, so no
test constrains these rows any more.

Deployment identity is deliberately unchanged by this map: the image and service
stay `ml-worker`, and `Dockerfile.edge`, `compose.edge.yaml`, `.env.edge.prod*`,
and the `ML_WORKER_*` / `WORKER_*` / `ML_API_*` / `API_*` prefixes keep their
legacy names. Only the Python package and the entrypoint change.

## Feature parity ledger

The ownership table above maps *files*. This ledger maps *user-observable
behaviour* from the original repository onto its v2 owner, so `edge/` can be
deleted without silently dropping a capability. It is the parity criterion for
the v2 cutover.

**Baseline: `eldercare-fall-ml` at committed `aeed6a8`.** Uncommitted work in
that checkout is out of scope for parity except where a row says otherwise.

Disposition vocabulary:

- `ported` — behaviour lives in the v2 owner and is covered by a behaviour test.
- `tracked-deferred` — intentionally not ported yet; a GitHub issue tracks it.
- `out-of-scope (uncommitted)` — present only as uncommitted work in the
  baseline checkout, so it is not part of the committed parity baseline.

Missing-capability rule: a missing **runtime feature** is reported to the user
and then restored; a missing **script or tool** is filed as a GitHub issue and
deferred; a missing **behaviour-coverage test** is restored as part of the
feature it proves. Developer-convenience harnesses are deferred with the tools.

## Open gaps

These are known divergences between the plan and the tree. They are recorded
here so nobody documents an intention as a fact.

**Resolved: the clip recording row used to be unprovable on macOS.** Two of
its cited tests, in `tests/test_clip_recorder.py`, failed on macOS, and the row
was recorded as Linux-only because
`worker/pipeline/output/evidence/evidence_media.py` handed `ffprobe` a
`/proc/self/fd/{descriptor}` reference. Neither holds any more. The recorder and
that test file were deleted in `db09fc1`, and the row now cites the Smart Record
and clip publication tests. Since `5e9c485`, `_probe_media()` in
`evidence_media.py` passes `/proc/self/fd/{descriptor}` when `/proc/self/fd`
exists and `/dev/fd/{descriptor}` otherwise. In both cases the path names the
file that `inspect_finalized_media()` already holds open, so the probe still
cannot be TOCTOU-swapped for a different file, and it does not require `/proc`.
`tests/test_evidence_trust_boundaries.py::test_media_probe_uses_same_open_inode_when_path_is_swapped`
pins the same-inode probe: `ffprobe` still reads the original bytes when the
path is swapped mid-probe. The test picks its descriptor root by the same rule.

On macOS, `tests/test_clip_export_reconciliation.py` and
`tests/test_evidence_trust_boundaries.py` now pass locally (19 passed), so the
row is dev-verified as well as CI-verified.

**Snapshot store used to be listed here too, and no longer is.** Three of its
cited tests also failed on macOS, but for an entirely different reason: they
read `/proc/self/fd` purely as *test instrumentation* to resolve a descriptor
back to a path and to count open descriptors. `snapshot_store.py` itself never
touches `/proc`, so nothing about the capability was Linux-only. Those tests now
use `fcntl(F_GETPATH)` and `/dev/fd` on macOS and the same `/proc` reads on
Linux, so the row is dev-verified on both. The distinction worth keeping: a
cited test failing on your machine may be pinning a real runtime floor, or may
just be instrumentation that was never written to be portable, and the two look
identical from the test report.

**Resolved: the shipped example config pinned a fall contract nothing produced.**
`worker/ml-worker.example.yaml` used to pin `models.fall.schema_version: 2`
and the current coco17 `preprocessing_identity`, while
`models/fall/lstm/metadata.yaml` declares neither — so it loads as
`LEGACY_SCHEMA_VERSION` (1) with the legacy identity, and the pinned pair was
refused. Neither side was malformed: the loader supports both generations as
first-class cases (`worker/adapters/model/lstm_manifest.py`,
`SUPPORTED_PREPROCESSING_IDENTITIES`), but the archived `eldercare-dataset-ops`
emitted `schema_version: 1` for fall and no preprocessing identity
(`ml/training/model_artifacts.py::build_fall_lstm_metadata`, which never
wrote either field), so schema_version 2 was not a contract any export path
produced — the example was documenting an aspirational target, not the
artifact it ships with.

The example was corrected to pin the legacy contract
(`schema_version: 1`, `legacy-coco17-xyc-frame-normalized-zero-fill-v1`) that
the shipped artifact satisfies and the archived training pipeline emitted, so
copying the example boots the fall model it ships with. If a fall artifact is
ever exported with `schema_version: 2` and the current coco17 identity,
replace `models/fall/lstm` with it and bump the example's pins back to the
v2 values at the same time — the fail-closed validation in
`_validate_expected_identity` (`worker/adapters/model/torch_lstm_fall.py`)
stays unchanged either way; only the pinned values move. The regression is
covered by
`tests/test_worker_real_warmup_no_stub.py::test_example_config_fall_contract_matches_the_local_artifact`.

**Operator scripts hang on heredocs larger than `PIPE_BUF`.**
Bash 5.3.15 writes a heredoc body into a pipe before exec'ing the reader, so a
body over `PIPE_BUF` blocks forever against a pipe nobody is draining — bash
never execs the command. The boundary is exact: on macOS (`PIPE_BUF` 512) a
512-byte body passes and 513 hangs; bash 3.2.57 stages heredocs in a temp file
and is unaffected at any size. The bash scripts under `scripts/` that pin
`#!/bin/bash` do so for this reason, which on macOS resolves to 3.2.57.

**That pin does not help on Linux.** There `PIPE_BUF` is 4096 and `/bin/bash` is
itself a modern bash, so only the threshold moves. Any heredoc body large enough
to cross the platform `PIPE_BUF` is exposed on a Linux edge host; moving such a
body into a file is the durable fix.

`tests/test_shell_script_heredoc_contract.py` enforces the rule at the 512-byte
threshold. It is a general contract: it walks every remaining `scripts/**/*.sh`
rather than naming individual scripts, so it keeps holding as the script surface
changes.

**`worker/pipeline/camera_pipeline.py` is gone.** It held `CameraPipelinePump`
and was deleted in `db09fc1` with the rest of the host media pipeline the
DeepStream Flow profile made redundant. Per-camera perception and decision
pumping now live in `worker/pipeline/perception/` and
`worker/runtime/flow/policy_pump.py` (`NativePolicyPump`). Lifecycle and
reconnect supervision live in `worker/runtime/flow/lifecycle_supervisor.py`
(`FlowLifecycleSupervisor`); composition and restart policy stay in
`worker/runtime/worker.py`. Do not cite `camera_pipeline.py` as a current owner.

**No `worker/runtime/supervisor.py` and no host `latest_frame.py` under a Flow
media-plane package.** The plan named both. Supervision landed in
`worker/runtime/flow/lifecycle_supervisor.py` as `FlowLifecycleSupervisor` with
restart policy in `worker/runtime/worker.py`, and the latest-frame store landed
in `worker/pipeline/output/live_view.py` as `LatestFrameStore` (a non-consuming
latest-value store, not a queue). The rows above reflect the real locations.

**ADR-0001 source-packet preservation is complete for primary clean clips.**
The worker keeps bounded encoded-packet history per camera and remuxes one
keyframe-aligned stream epoch/configuration without transcoding. Decoded frames
remain analysis and optional snapshot taps. Transformed derivative publication
is not a current production surface.

Decision-trace replay is written by the worker as bounded on-disk JSONL
(`worker/pipeline/trace/replay_trace_writer.py`), enabled only when a replay
trace directory is configured. It is a replay-fidelity input, not the
original-run observability record (that is the execution-record path,
`worker/pipeline/diagnostics/`). There is no backend
analysis-trace HTTP or database warehouse.

### Replay trace v2

Flow policy pumps may emit replay-trace-v2 JSONL under the trace root only when
its environment gate is enabled. Files are named from a hashed camera id
and remain contained beneath that root, with bounded rotations. Every row has
unit coordinates and its frame dimensions; `seq` is ordered within a boot
segment across rotations. `open` starts a new boot segment and resets replay
state; `reconnect` retains it, and `lost` contributes no observation. Control
rows carry no tracks, and only `frame` rows enter PTS resampling. Persisted
bed polygons also carry `bed_polygon_image_size`, their original image-space
dimensions, so replay reconstructs the production geometry.

This supersedes the abbreviated replay schema in the approved plan.

The authenticated clip artifact projection exposes clean video plus an optional
snapshot. There is no persisted analysis or overlay artifact view, and no
overlay fallback to clean playback. Snapshot JPEG derivatives may contain
burned overlay pixels; primary clip bytes never do.

**Encoder-lifecycle work is risk reduction, not a GPU fix.** The per-camera
encoder session, segment ring, and their instrumentation reduce the window in
which a hardware encoder is left in a bad state and make faults observable.
They do not diagnose or repair any Xid GPU fault, and nothing in this migration
may be presented as fixing one.
