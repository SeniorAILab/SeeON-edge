# Architecture

The worker is one process that turns RTSP frames into business events. It is
organised as five layers with one direction of flow, a single canonical
entrypoint, and an explicit rule about which envelopes may carry pixels. This
document is the decision record for that shape: what each layer owns, what state
is per camera, what happens on each class of failure, and which legacy module
became which worker module.

Read the scoped `AGENTS.md` next to the code you are changing for the
per-package import ceiling. Boundaries are enforced by import-linter
(`uv run --group lint lint-imports`), not by convention.

## Layers

Flow is one-way. A layer may depend on the layer above it and on
`worker/types` and `worker/interfaces`; it may never reach back down.

```

`worker/runtime/` is the composition root: it builds the layers, owns the
bootstrap gates, the GPU lease, the watchdog, and the fault handler. It is the
only package permitted to import everything.

## Types and the contracts boundary

Worker-internal ports and envelopes live under `worker/`; cross-instance L0 data
stays in `contracts`. `contracts/` is ADR-0004 vendored byte-for-byte from
`eldercare-dataset-ops` and is snapshotted by `tests/test_vendor_drift.py`,
including `contracts/AGENTS.md` — never edit anything under it as part of worker
work, and never duplicate or shadow a vendored type inside `worker/`.

| Envelope | Module | Carries pixels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FramePacket` | `worker/types/frame_packet.py` | yes |
| `ModuleResult` | `worker/types/module_result.py` | no |
| `DecisionInput` | `worker/types/decision_input.py` | no |
| `BusinessEvent` | `worker/types/business_event.py` | no |

## Raw-image vs numeric fan-out

`FramePacket` is the only envelope permitted to carry an image. Four
subscribers may receive it, and no others:

| Subscriber | Why it needs pixels |
| --- | --- |
| Model extraction | runs the person/pose/bed-seg adapters |
| Derivative evidence | feeds the per-camera segment encoder for clips |
| Overlay / MJPEG live view | draws debug output for operators |
| Alert snapshot | encodes the single bounded JPEG attached to an alert |

Everything downstream of analytics is numeric.
`DecisionInput` carries exactly the seven fields `observation`, `frame_width`,
`frame_height`, `live_track_ids`, `time_sec`, `frame_index`, and `bed_region` —
no array, no buffer, no handle from which a frame could be recovered. A domain
detector that needs a pixel is a design error: add an extractor in layer 3 and
pass the number it produced.

## Per-camera state vs shared state

Anything temporal belongs to exactly one camera. Anything expensive and
stateless is built once per process. `tests/test_worker_per_camera_fall_state.py`
guards both halves.

| State | Scope | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tracker | per camera | `worker/pipeline/perception/tracker.py` |
| SceneState | per camera | `worker/pipeline/perception/scene_state.py` |
| Window buffer and fall probabilities | per camera | `worker/pipeline/perception/window_buffer.py` |
| Fall latch | per camera | `worker/domains/fall/detector.py` |
| Bed assignments, grace/hold, night window | per camera | `worker/domains/bed_exit/` |
| IncidentManager | per camera | `worker/pipeline/decision/incident_manager.py` |
| Frame-bus subscription and scheduler slot | per camera | `worker/pipeline/bus/` |
| Encoder session and segment ring | per camera | `worker/adapters/encode/session.py` |
| Ingest loop and reconnect backoff | per camera | `worker/pipeline/ingest/lifecycle.py` |
| Model objects and extractor instances | shared, one per task per process | `worker/runtime/model_composition.py` |
| Resolved profile and device selection | shared, one per process | `worker/runtime/profile/` |
| GPU lease | shared, one per process | `worker/runtime/lease.py` |
| Config / LKG store | shared, one per process | `worker/runtime/config/` |
| Evidence outbox database | shared, one per process | `worker/pipeline/output/evidence/evidence_outbox_database.py` |
| Clip store lock | shared, one per host directory | `worker/pipeline/output/evidence/clip_store_lock.py` |

Sharing a per-camera row across cameras is a correctness bug, not an
optimisation: it leaks one resident's motion history into another's fall
decision.

## Entrypoint

The canonical and only command is:

```sh
python -m worker
```

`worker/__main__.py` owns the CLI: it parses argv, loads config, constructs
`WorkerRuntime` directly, and maps outcomes to exit codes. `worker/runtime/worker.py`
stays composition-only and exports exactly three classes —
`CameraRuntimeContext`, `HeartbeatReporter`, `WorkerRuntime`. There is no
module-level `main` there and no delegate indirection; earlier drafts of this
document claimed one, and that claim was wrong. Do not add an alias module, a
console script, or a per-submodule `python -m` target: one entrypoint is a plan
requirement.

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | clean shutdown |
| 1 | generic runtime error |
| 2 | config or resolution error |
| 3 | refuse-to-start (a bootstrap gate failed) |
| 4 | fatal accelerator fault (`worker/runtime/faults/handler.py`, hard exit) |

## Failure matrix

Global faults kill the process loudly. Per-camera faults degrade exactly one
camera. There is no silent CPU or OpenCV fallback, and `auto` device selection
is a loud failure, per ADR-0002.

| Fault | Scope | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Profile unresolvable / `auto` requested | global | refuse to start, exit 3 |
| Requested accelerator unavailable at boot | global | refuse to start, exit 3, reason logged |
| Decode capability probe fails for the profile | global | refuse to start, exit 3 |
| Model artifact missing or unloadable | global | refuse to start, exit 3 |
| Real warmup inference fails | global | refuse to start, exit 3 |
| GPU lease already held by another process | global | refuse to start, exit 3 |
| Config invalid and no LKG available | global | exit 2 |
| Config invalid but LKG present | global | run from LKG, report degraded status |
| Accelerator fault mid-run (device lost, unrecoverable) | global | record first fault, hard exit 4 for supervised restart |
| Inference deadline exceeded | global | watchdog records and escalates to the fault path |
| RTSP connect/auth failure | per camera | that camera retries with backoff; others unaffected |
| Decode stall or stream EOF | per camera | reopen the source; camera reports unhealthy meanwhile |
| Frame bus full | per camera | drop oldest, increment drop metric; never block ingest |
| Extractor raises on one frame | per camera | frame dropped, camera continues |
| Clip encode failure | per camera | alert still relays; evidence marked incomplete |
| Relay POST failure | per camera | durable outbox retries; no event is lost in memory |
| Clip store locked by another process | global | worker refuses to start: two workers must not share one outbox (ADR-0003) |
| Evidence delivery enabled but misconfigured or unable to initialise | global | worker refuses to start rather than run with alerts stranded in the local outbox (ADR-0003) |

Rollback of a bad worker image is image-digest based; see
[`docs/runbooks/worker-migration-rollback.md`](runbooks/worker-migration-rollback.md).

## Source-to-target ownership

Every non-`__init__` source file in the legacy tree has exactly one owner below.
These rows are historical citations of a migration, not operator instructions.
`tests/test_worker_architecture_docs.py` asserts the map stays complete and
unambiguous while the legacy tree exists, and stops constraining it once the
tree is deleted.

and the `ML_WORKER_*` / `WORKER_*` / `ML_API_*` / `API_*` prefixes keep their
legacy names. Only the Python package and the entrypoint change.

## Feature parity ledger

The ownership table above maps *files*. This ledger maps *user-observable
behaviour* from the original repository onto its v2 owner, so `edge/` can be
deleted without silently dropping a capability. It is the parity criterion for
the v2 cutover.

**Baseline: `eldercare-fall-ml` at committed `aeed6a8`.** Uncommitted work in
that checkout is out of scope for parity except where a row says otherwise.

Disposition vocabulary:

- `ported` — behaviour lives in the v2 owner and is covered by a behaviour test.
- `tracked-deferred` — intentionally not ported yet; a GitHub issue tracks it.
- `out-of-scope (uncommitted)` — present only as uncommitted work in the
  baseline checkout, so it is not part of the committed parity baseline.

Missing-capability rule: a missing **runtime feature** is reported to the user
and then restored; a missing **script or tool** is filed as a GitHub issue and
deferred; a missing **behaviour-coverage test** is restored as part of the
feature it proves. Developer-convenience harnesses are deferred with the tools.

`eldercare-fall-ml@aeed6a8` carries ten uncommitted entries in its checkout.
Two are tracked above; the remaining eight are `out-of-scope (uncommitted)`:

## Open gaps

These are known divergences between the plan and the tree. They are recorded
here so nobody documents an intention as a fact.

**The shipped example config cannot load the fall artifact that ships with it.**
`worker/ml-worker.example.yaml` pins `models.fall.schema_version: 2` and a
coco17 `preprocessing_identity`, while `models/fall/lstm/metadata.yaml` declares
neither, so its manifest defaults to schema version 1 and the loader refuses the
pair. That refusal is correct (ADR-0003 fail-closed); which side is canonical
belongs to `eldercare-dataset-ops`. Pinned by a passing negative test in
`tests/test_worker_real_warmup_no_stub.py`. Tracked in
[#8](https://github.com/SeniorAILab/eldercare-fall-ml-v2/issues/8).

**`uv run pytest -q` does not complete without a `--deselect`.**
`tests/test_edge_topology_contract.py::test_real_rtsp_bedexit_script_generates_supported_production_config`
calls `scripts/ml-worker-real-rtsp-bedexit-e2e.sh` through `subprocess.run` with
no timeout, and the script hangs. Root cause: the script's `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
resolves to Homebrew bash 5.3.15, which blocks setting up the `python3 - <<'PY'`
heredoc in `compute_windows` — it never execs `python3` at all. The identical
script under `/bin/bash` (3.2.57) exits 0 and renders its config. Deterministic,
5/5. Tracked in
[#9](https://github.com/SeniorAILab/eldercare-fall-ml-v2/issues/9), which also
records the five hypotheses checked and rejected on the way there.

**No `worker/pipeline/camera_pipeline.py`.** The migration plan names that file
as the owner of `edge/runtime/camera_worker.py`, and it does not exist. The
orchestration it was meant to hold is currently spread across
`worker/pipeline/ingest/lifecycle.py`, `worker/pipeline/analytics/composite.py`,
and `worker/runtime/worker.py`. The ownership row above describes that split
because that is what is on disk. Either introduce the file and move the
orchestration into it, or amend the plan's Scope table — do not describe the
file as if it were there.

**No `worker/runtime/supervisor.py` and no `worker/pipeline/bus/latest_frame.py`.**
The plan named both. Supervision landed in `worker/pipeline/ingest/lifecycle.py`
as `IngestSupervisor` with restart policy in `worker/runtime/worker.py`, and the
latest-frame store landed in `worker/pipeline/output/live_view.py` as
`LatestFrameStore` (a non-consuming latest-value store, not a queue). The rows
above reflect the real locations.

**ADR-0001 source-packet preservation is NOT complete.** It remains an open
follow-up, tracked at
<https://github.com/SeniorAILab/eldercare-fall-ml-v2/issues/2>, and no todo in
this migration closes it. Stored clips are produced by re-encoding
decoded-frame data through the segment encoder, so a clip is a decoded-frame
derivative and does **not** satisfy that requirement — it is not the original
source stream. Never describe worker clip output as original-stream or
bit-exact evidence.

**Encoder-lifecycle work is risk reduction, not a GPU fix.** The per-camera
encoder session, segment ring, and their instrumentation reduce the window in
which a hardware encoder is left in a bad state and make faults observable.
They do not diagnose or repair any Xid GPU fault, and nothing in this migration
may be presented as fixing one. Host driver and CUDA faults are handled by
[`docs/runbooks/driver-cuda-alignment.md`](runbooks/driver-cuda-alignment.md).
