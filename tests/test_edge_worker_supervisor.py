"""EdgeWorkerSupervisor -> IngestSupervisor migration.

Every edge assertion this file used to carry has one of four dispositions
(reported in full to the orchestrator alongside this change); this file keeps
only the one guarantee that has no existing worker-side test:

- one-offline-camera isolation, RTSP degraded->ready recovery, and the
  "runner never touches the capture thread" guarantee are all superseded by
  tests/test_worker_ingest_lifecycle.py and tests/test_worker_camera_pipeline_pump.py
  (IngestSupervisor wires ingest and pump loops as physically separate threads,
  so extraction structurally cannot run on the capture thread -- a stronger
  guarantee than edge's callback-based `test_runner_called_by_scheduler_only`).
- the two-bed-boxes-not-misread-as-pose-pair guarantee is now structural:
  worker/pipeline/analytics/merge.py dispatches by `module_name` through a
  typed `_RESULT_MERGERS` table (singledispatch registered against each
  concrete RunnerResult), so edge's isinstance-based branch-guessing bug class
  cannot recur.
- heartbeat gating (only a READY transition can reach the relay) is ported
  below directly against `HeartbeatReporter`, which now owns that guarantee.
- `test_supervisor_processing_updates_measured_fps` is ported below against
  `CameraPipelinePump._record_measured_fps` (worker/pipeline/camera_pipeline.py):
  a production gap closed under todo 20 -- nothing called
  `WorkerDiagnostics.update_measured_fps` per frame until the pump was wired
  to do so, mirroring edge's `_record_measured_fps` 10s sliding-window
  algorithm verbatim.
