# PROJECT KNOWLEDGE BASE

**Generated:** 2026-10-06
**Commit:** 30d9ce5
**Branch:** main

Python/uv + React monorepo for fall and bed-exit detection. Three deployable
instances (`front`, `backend`, `worker`) plus `shared` and the canonical
`contracts` leaf. This repository's `contracts/` is the authority; the copy in
the archived `eldercare-dataset-ops` is historical only. Import-linter
(`[tool.importlinter]` in `pyproject.toml`) owns the boundaries. Historical
training lived in the archived `eldercare-dataset-ops`. Local weights stay
under `models/` and are never committed.

## Package Boundaries

| Package | Ownership |
| --- | --- |
| `front` | React/Vite SPA. Feature-sliced: `src/features/*`, `src/shared/{ui,api}`, `src/app`. Talks to the backend only over same-origin `/api/v1`. |
| `backend` | FastAPI gateway. Eleven vertical slices under `app/features/*` (router + store); `app/lifespan.py` is its composition root. |
| `worker` | DeepStream Flow worker. SDK media plane, CPU domain decisions, evidence, and relay egress. |
| `shared` | `shared.events` (backend↔worker wire). |
| `contracts` | ADR-0006 canonical typed-vocabulary leaf and the contract authority; the archived `eldercare-dataset-ops` copy is historical only. |
| `tests` | pytest contracts and boundary coverage. |

`backend` and `worker` do not import each other. HTTP relay is the command/event
boundary. The backend alone opens PostgreSQL through `backend.app.edge_db`;
the worker has no database. That database is persistence, never polling IPC.

Directory names are `front`/`backend`/`worker`. Deployment images keep the
legacy identity: `ml-api` (`Dockerfile.backend`, `ML_API_`/`API_*`) and
`ml-worker` (`Dockerfile.edge`, `WORKER_*`/`ML_WORKER_*`). Do not rename those
prefixes. `front` is built into the backend image and served at `/`.

`flow` is the only production worker profile. The DeepStream Flow owns capture,
decode, inference, and tracking inside the SDK. Only
`worker/adapters/deepstream/` may import `pyservicemaker` or `pyds`, and those
imports stay lazy so host modules import without the SDK. `worker.runtime` is
the sole composition root. The worker is an RTSP client only.

## Code Map

| Surface | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend factory | `backend/app/main.py` | `create_app()` registers 19 feature routers under `/api/v1`, seeds `app.state.edge_relay_token` (handlers never re-read the env), mounts `front` dist. Unversioned probes stay at `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, and `/health/release-identity`. |
| Worker CLI | `worker/__main__.py` | `python -m worker`, the sole production command. Parses flags, loads config, constructs `WorkerRuntime`. Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 generic, 2 config, 3 refuse-to-start, 4 fatal accelerator (never caught to retry). Containers pass the mounted volume as `--state-dir`. |
| Composition root | `worker/runtime/worker.py` | Composes the Flow plane, CPU policy, evidence, and relay. |
| Flow runtime | `worker/runtime/flow/` | Media-plane lifecycle, metadata admission, policy pump, and evidence handoff. The Flow process never imports torch or ultralytics. |
| Vendor adapter | `worker/adapters/deepstream/` | Lazy DeepStream Service Maker integration and vendor-metadata conversion. |
| Domain decisions | `worker/domains/` | CPU fall and bed-exit decisions. `DETECTION_MODULE_REGISTRY` (`fall.v2`, `bed_exit.v1`) is the extension surface; `EpisodeAuthority` alone mints event identity. |
| Engine build and gate | `worker/tools/` | Flow engines are image-owned artifacts: `edge_engine_build.py` builds the nvinfer engine ahead of source activation, never at boot; boot verifies digests and deployed-batch identity before accepting sources and rejects a mismatch. `export_pose_onnx.py` exports the dynamic-batch pose ONNX used by the engine build gate. `fetch_models` (compose service `edge-model-fetch`) pulls weights. `worker.tools` is banned from every production layer. |
| Evidence | `worker/pipeline/output/evidence/` | Smart record actor, clip publication, sealed sidecar, durable stager, delivery queue, and snapshot store. |
| Event wire | `shared/events/` | Schemas and `edge_ingest_client.py` (events and clip receipts to the backend over relay HTTP). |
| Dashboard | `front/src/app/App.tsx` | `AuthGate` + `Dashboard`. Pages: events, operations, settings. |
| Edge database | `backend/app/edge_db/` | PostgreSQL is the only durable store (`postgres.py` and the `postgres_*.sql` schemas). `migration/` imports the retired schema-19 `edge.sqlite3` once and is the only code that reads SQLite. |

Read the nearest scoped `AGENTS.md` before changing a package: `worker/`,
`backend/app/`, `shared/`, `contracts/`, `front/`, `tests/`, `tests_support/`,
`scripts/`, and `docs/` each have one, most with deeper files beneath them.

## Commands

From the repo root:

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest -q
uv run pytest -q -m "not real_stack and not heavy and not integration"  # CI filter
uvx ruff check .
uv run --group lint lint-imports  # architecture boundaries
uv run --group lint mypy contracts shared
docker build -f Dockerfile.backend .
docker build -f Dockerfile.edge .
pnpm --dir front install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm --dir front test
pnpm --dir front build && pnpm --dir front lint
```

## Conventions

- `contracts/` is the contract authority (ADR-0006); nothing mirrors it to or
  drift-checks it against the archived `eldercare-dataset-ops`. Domain decision
  math stays worker-internal.
- Worker→backend command/event traffic is one-way over relay HTTP. The backend's
  PostgreSQL database is never worker persistence or polling IPC.
- Cameras are registered at runtime through the dashboard registry. Do not seed
  them from env, YAML, or a backend `cameras` pull.
- Use `uv`. Re-run `lint-imports` after any import-boundary change.
- Dashboard UI: icons and buttons over text; status is an icon, secondary flows
  are popups, overlay subjects are per-subject toggles that persist. See
  `front/AGENTS.md` "Owner UI preferences".

## Anti-patterns

- No `backend`↔`worker` imports. Relay HTTP only.
- No RTSP publisher, MediaMTX, or FFmpeg stream server on the worker.
- No committed model artifacts or training code.
- No real-stack E2E in CI. Mark those tests `real_stack`; `ci.yml` deselects them.
- No required CI check behind `if:` or `paths:` (a skipped check reads green); no
  secrets, RTSP URLs, or camera IPs in docs, issues, or shell history.
- No `docker compose down -v`, `edge-state` deletion, or direct SQL repair of
  `edge.sqlite3`; no mutable image tags (`latest`, `:dev`) or hand-written digests.
- Production edge runs the `main-<sha>` images CI built from a `main` commit —
  `ML_API_IMAGE`/`ML_WORKER_IMAGE` pinned to the `@sha256:` digests CI recorded
  (in the job summary or the `edge-ml-image-refs-<sha>` artifact) — brought up
  with `compose.edge.yaml` (plus the
  required hardware overlay) and invoked with `--pull never`. Never run the edge
  from a dev checkout or via bind-mounts of source code. Rationale: in 2026-09 an
  unmerged branch ended up running as production code, which caused about 1,780
  false-positive alerts.
- 기사님한테 회사 숙제 시키기: baking company-known deploy values (backend URL)
  into a field-tech form. Company-known values go in env/image; only site-local
  values (facility id, token) stay in the UI.
- 조립 루트 스텁 배선: production seam defaults that are always-fail stubs so
  `worker/runtime` boots with a dead feature. Seam defaults are `None`; missing
  wiring must refuse to start (ADR-0002). Always-fail stubs belong in tests only.
- 암묵 정책: model choice, Flow parser behavior, extract schedule, or result
  priority hidden in branch fall-through or dict insertion order. Lift the
  decision to an explicit owner (registry, config, declaration).
- No JSON state stores for application data. Mutable application state belongs in
  the backend-owned PostgreSQL database (`backend/app/edge_db`); the inference-runtime
  slot holds no database at all (ADR-0005) and uses only its approved bounded
  file surfaces: the publish-once delivery queue, a verified bounded config read
  cache, media-integrity sidecars, zero-payload lock inodes, and startup-purged
  scratch. Content-addressed evidence files (`manifest.json`, `scene-index.json`,
  snapshots) are the exception.
- 침묵하는 `extra=` 로그: `worker/__main__.py` `basicConfig` renders
  `%(message)s` only. Operator-visible fields (camera_id) must live in the
  message string. Assert `record.getMessage()`, not LogRecord extras.

## Notes

- Image names and `ML_*`/`API_*`/`WORKER_*` prefixes are frozen. Renaming
  breaks `.env.edge.prod`, GHCR, and `contracts/worker_config.py`.

## Development Flow Recipe

Use an issue-driven loop for all repository work:

1. Open or select one GitHub issue describing the change.
2. Before starting new work, confirm the base worktree has no tracked local changes, then run `git fetch origin` and `git pull --ff-only` on the default branch so the work starts from the latest remote commit. Never pull across uncommitted work or discard user changes; create/reuse the task worktree only after the base is current.
3. Never commit directly on `main`. Use a worktree when you need isolation: `git wt <name>` creates (or reuses) a named worktree off the updated default branch. Reuse a small fixed pool (e.g. `lane-1`~`lane-3`) rather than making a new one per issue.
4. Plan first for non-trivial work: write the intended change, affected files, verification, and rollback note before editing.
5. Fan out into small PRs when a change spans unrelated domains, mixes assets with logic, or needs independent review lanes.
6. Attach review evidence to each PR: tests or checks run, screenshots/transcripts for user-facing behavior, and the issue or planning links that justify the change.
7. Merge only after review. If the user explicitly asks to record a durable decision, hand off to the `document` skill and use `docs/decisions/` as the destination.

Conventions agents must follow:

- Keep each change scoped to its issue. When work — planning, a requirements interview, or implementation — surfaces an out-of-scope problem (a new topic, unrelated bug, or follow-up idea beyond the current issue), open a new GitHub issue for it with one Type label instead of expanding the current change.
- Plan before editing non-trivial code.
- Prefer fan-out PRs over broad mixed-purpose PRs.
- Include review evidence before requesting/performing review.
- Do not merge before review.
- Do not create or require ADRs unless the user explicitly asks for ADRs.
