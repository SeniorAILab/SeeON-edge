"""Decide, per edge image, whether that image has to be rebuilt for a release.

Both Dockerfiles take ``SOURCE_REVISION`` and stamp it into
``org.opencontainers.image.revision`` (``Dockerfile.backend`` and
``Dockerfile.edge``), so building an unchanged tree at a new commit produces a
*new* digest. Per-image isolation therefore cannot come from "the rebuild is
reproducible" -- it never is. It has to come from **not rebuilding**: when an
image's inputs did not change, the digest that is already published is given the
new release's tag and emitted unchanged into the release manifest.

Two things have to be right for that to be safe.

**What counts as an input.** Not a matter of taste: it is exactly what each
Dockerfile ``COPY``s out of the build context, plus the Dockerfile itself, plus
the files that decide what the context *contains*
(``.dockerignore``) or how it is built (the workflow). A path that belongs to an
image but is missing from its set means the image is not rebuilt when it should
be, and the release ships a stale digest under a new version.
``tests/test_edge_image_isolation.py`` re-derives the ``COPY`` sources from both
Dockerfiles and fails if anything here drifts from them.

**What to compare against.** Not the previous release's commit -- the commit
that actually built the digest being reused. Those differ as soon as an image is
reused twice: if ``ml-api`` was built at C1 for v0.1.0 and reused for v0.2.0,
then at v0.3.0 the published digest is still the one built at C1, so the
comparison has to run C1..C3. Comparing against v0.2.0's commit would skip
everything that changed between C1 and C2 and reuse a genuinely stale image.
The build commit is read back from the image's own
``org.opencontainers.image.revision`` label, which makes the registry
self-describing and the reuse chain self-correcting.

Unknown paths **fail closed**: a path this module cannot classify is treated as
affecting *both* images, so a new top-level directory costs a redundant rebuild
rather than a silently skipped one.
