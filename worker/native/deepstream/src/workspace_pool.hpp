// A bounded free-list pool and its RAII lease.
//
// This exists because a single TensorRT execution context serialized every
// camera in the deployment: with N sources the per-camera frame rate is
// 1/(N * critical_section), which measured 11.3fps against a 15fps target on a
// 13-camera stack. Concurrency has to be bounded and explicit - an unbounded
// pool would trade a throughput ceiling for an out-of-memory one.
//
// The pool is deliberately free of CUDA and TensorRT so its concurrency and
// exhaustion behaviour can be tested on a host without a GPU. It owns nothing:
// the caller keeps the elements alive for the pool's lifetime.
