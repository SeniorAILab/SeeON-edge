# worker

RTSP inference client: ingest, bounded bus, extract, decide, evidence, one-way relay egress.
Image `ml-worker`. Sole production command: `python -m worker`.
Replay is backend-owned; the production worker has no replay CLI.

## Layers

Run `uv run --group lint lint-imports`; a forbidden import means the design is wrong: add a Protocol in `interfaces/` and inject from `runtime/`.

| Package | Role | Worker-layer ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `types/` | internal envelopes | no other `worker` layer |
| `interfaces/` | one Protocol per seam | `types` |
| `adapters/` | decode, model, encode | `types`, `interfaces` |
| `pipeline/` | ingest, bus, perception, decision, output | everything except `runtime` |
| `domains/` | fall and bed-exit | `types`, `interfaces`, `pipeline.perception` |
| `native/deepstream/` | native child + Python wire/preflight seam | `types` |
| `runtime/` | composition root | everything |
| `tools/deepstream_canary/` | host-side operator qualification tool | out of the production import graph |

Order: `runtime -> pipeline -> domains -> adapters -> interfaces -> types -> contracts`.
`contracts` contains cross-instance L0 data only. Worker-internal ports and envelopes live under `worker/`; never duplicate or shadow a vendored type, including `contracts/AGENTS.md`.
Shared leaves are scope-owned: `detection_policies`, `events`, and
`rtsp_url_policy`. Worker never imports `backend` or database modules. The
`nvidia` production path consumes `native/deepstream/` from `runtime/`;
`tools/deepstream_canary/` remains out-of-band and is excluded from the image.

## Data and lifetime boundaries

`types/AGENTS.md` owns the pixel/numeric envelope contract. `runtime/AGENTS.md` owns process-shared versus per-camera allocation. Keep both boundaries intact; details stay in those scoped guides.

## Hardware failure policy

`runtime/AGENTS.md` owns boot exit codes, profile defaults, fault persistence, camera-local degradation, and lifecycle. `adapters/AGENTS.md` owns explicit backend fallback. `pipeline/AGENTS.md` owns queue overflow, and `pipeline/output/evidence/AGENTS.md` owns delivery durability. Read those scoped guides before changing failure behavior.

## Package navigation

Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` before changing that package.

New seam: Protocol plus two implementations, or one plus a test double.
Keep new pure-code modules at or below 250 logical LOC. Split by port or stage.
