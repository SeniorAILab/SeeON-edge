"""Named 6-stage 2-tier bootstrap gates (ADR-0002, todo 26).

Two tiers with deliberately different blast radii:

- **Global stages** run once at process start, in one canonical order: gpu lease
  -> profile/device -> decode capability -> model backend init -> real warmup ->
  camera activation.  Any global-stage failure activates *zero* cameras, releases
  the GPU lease, and exits non-zero.  There is no CPU or software-encoder
  fallback anywhere on this path.
- **Per-camera stages** run once per camera.  A failure degrades only that camera
  (:func:`run_camera_stage` returns a failed outcome) and the process keeps
  running for the others.

Exit codes follow the canonical worker set (`0/1/2/3/4`):
:data:`GENERIC_RUNTIME_EXIT_CODE` (1) for an ordinary stage failure,
:data:`REFUSE_TO_START_EXIT_CODE` (3) when a precondition means we must not start
at all (lease contention, profile/device or decode mismatch), and
:data:`FATAL_ACCELERATOR_EXIT_CODE` (4) whenever a
:class:`~worker.adapters.model.errors.FatalAcceleratorError` surfaces — that code
wins over the stage's own code, because "the accelerator context is retired, do
not restart in place" must stay distinguishable from a plain crash.

Each :class:`Stage` is a *zero-argument* named callable.  Stages communicate
through the mutable :class:`BootstrapContext` they close over rather than by
threading a dict of prior outputs, so a stage that runs out of order fails
loudly on an unset context field instead of silently reading a missing key.  The
context is also what makes lease release possible from the failure path: the
process holds exactly one lease and exactly one place knows about it.

Warmup deliberately holds no CUDA knowledge.  The composition root injects
per-task callables (typically
``lambda runner: warmup_to_ready(runner, device=..., synchronize=...)``), so the
"synchronize after every forward on cuda" rule lives in
:func:`worker.adapters.model.warmup.warmup_to_ready` and is not reimplemented
here.
