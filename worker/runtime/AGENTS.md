# worker/runtime: composition root

Own process lifecycle and wiring: config, profile, staged bootstrap, GPU containment, camera supervision, telemetry, CLI. Business math and model parse stay out.
`worker.runtime` is the only package that may import everything (`types`, `interfaces`, `adapters`, `pipeline`, `domains`, `contracts`, `shared.events`). Nothing imports it.
Import-linter: "worker runtime is the sole composition root". Runtime constructs, injects, and owns lifecycle.
Perception math, domain judgment, and vendor kits live elsewhere. `backend` is forbidden. Relay HTTP only.

## Ownership rule

- `worker.py`: `WorkerRuntime`. Non-`nvidia` profiles compose shared models and per-camera ingest, tracker, `SceneState`, scheduler, domain deciders, bus, pump, and coordinator.
  `nvidia` instead composes one native media plane plus per-camera `NativePolicyPump`s. Both wire evidence, policy, telemetry, and shutdown.
  `TemporalProfile` is the fps contract; `_preflight_camera_graph` passes it into registry activation so `Scheduler(dict(resolved_plan.schedule))` is computed, not hardcoded.
- `bootstrap.py`: `gpu_lease -> profile/device -> decode_capability -> model_backend_init -> real_warmup -> camera_activation`. Mutable `BootstrapContext` owns the lease.
- `model_composition.py`: `SharedComponentPool` by artifact identity.
- `ingest_composition.py`: profile decode token plus optional camera override. Unknown token or `nvdec` without an nvdec profile raises.
- `profile/`: `ML_WORKER_PROFILE` to the canonical `(device, decode, preprocess, inference, overlay, encode)` and memory-path descriptor.
  `nvidia` is routed by `worker.py` to the native media plane instead of host adapter construction. Unset or blank becomes `cpu`; unknown names fail closed.
- `config/`: models, resolver, relay pull, LKG, restart epoch. YAML is a developer hatch. No env roster.
- `provenance/`: applied runtime manifest delivered through the backend relay.
- `telemetry/`: `StatusStore`, `WorkerDiagnostics`, `RuntimeStatusSender`. Local snapshot can grow. Relay wire stays frozen.
- `faults/`: one first-fault record, stop every loop, `os._exit(4)`.
- `lease.py`: advisory flock at `~/.local/state/ml-worker/.gpu.lease`. Acquire before CUDA, NVDEC, or model construction. No env override.
- `watchdog.py`: hung forward drives the same `FaultHandler` path.
- `deepstream/`: `nvidia`-only native media plane. `worker.py` verifies the content-addressed plan cache, starts one `NvidiaMediaPlane`, and drives the existing policy/evidence plane through image-free `NativePolicyPump`s.
  The child owns GPU 0; the parent has no in-process serving. A tracker remains in each preflighted `CameraDetectionPlan` but is not executed on this path.

## Failures, allocation, CLI, tests

Global stages are fatal. Failed named stage starts zero cameras and exits non-zero. Lease, profile/device, and decode miss exit 3; ordinary stage failure exits 1.
`FatalAcceleratorError` exits 4 and outranks the stage code. Lease is released before exit. `run_camera_stage` degrades only that camera; `FatalAcceleratorError` still re-raises because GPU context is process-wide.
RTSP failure retries with backoff. Decode stall reopens the source. Source open failure is camera `DEGRADED` plus `camera.offline`; later processing failure is not offline.
Missing evidence wiring or a locked local store refuses to start. Remote delivery is classified: retry classes retry, compatibility failures reprobe, and payload-invalid failures become permanent. Two workers must not share one outbox.
NVENC may demote to `libx264` during preflight and once per camera after session-open failure, logged. VAAPI may demote to `opencv` at boot. NVDEC and OpenCV decode stay fail-fast.
Mid-run device loss writes one first-fault record, stops every camera, hard-exits 4. Under `nvidia`, native fatal exit also persists one first-fault record and hard-exits 4; the CUDA context exists only in the child and is never recreated in-process.
Worker never queries Xid state. Zero configured cameras is a valid boot.

For non-`nvidia`, shared-once ownership includes models, extractors, serving
client, and coordinator; per-camera ownership includes tracker, `SceneState`,
window buffer, bus, encoder ring, result slot, and live observation cache.
`nvidia` shares the native media plane and uses per-camera policy pumps instead.
All profiles share profile/device, GPU lease, config/LKG, evidence outbox,
clip-store lock, audit overlay, snapshot store, and diagnostics; domain policy
state and evidence attachers remain per camera. Hoisting a per-camera row leaks one resident into another.
`tests/test_worker_per_camera_fall_state.py` asserts both halves.

Seam defaults are `None`. Missing wiring refuses to start (ADR-0002).
Always-fail stubs belong in tests only. Pass the real MJPEG probe,
`serving_client`, ingest loop, and evidence path, or refuse boot. Never omit
an argument and let `_unavailable_probe` ship a dead feature while boot
succeeds. Root anti-pattern "조립 루트 스텁 배선". `serving_client` has no
default. Fall model must be explicit.

`worker/__main__.py` owns argparse and exit codes and constructs
`WorkerRuntime` from `worker.runtime.worker`
directly. Don't add `worker.runtime.edge_worker` or an `edge` alias. Keep
`--config`, `--check-config`, `--heartbeat-on-start`,
`--max-frames-per-camera`, `--backfill-thumbnails`, and signal shutdown.
Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 generic, 2 config, 3 refuse-to-start, 4 fatal
accelerator. `--check-config` has no model, camera, or relay side effect.
Production pulls from the baked relay plus `RELAY_TOKEN`. `RELAY_URL` is
retired. `--backfill-thumbnails` writes missing `thumbnail.jpg` and exits
non-zero while any playable clip lacks one.

Focused tests: `tests/test_profile_boot.py`, `tests/test_pipeline_bootstrap.py`,
`tests/test_worker_per_camera_fall_state.py`, `tests/test_worker_composition.py`,
`tests/test_worker_cli_residue.py`, `tests/test_runtime_manifest.py`,
`tests/test_worker_gpu_lease.py`, `tests/test_worker_fatal_accelerator.py`.
Boundary: `uv run --group lint lint-imports`. New observability lands in
structured logs and the local snapshot. Strict backend `RelayRuntimeStatusRequest` stays byte-for-byte compatible. Operator-visible fields belong in the message string.
