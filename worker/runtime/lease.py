"""Repo-wide advisory GPU lease (todo 26).

One non-blocking ``flock`` under ``ML_WORKER_STATE_DIR`` serializes GPU access
across every process in this repository: the worker itself plus the smoke/replay
commands.  Two workers sharing one GPU is the failure mode this removes — the
second entrant loses the lease and exits *before* it touches CUDA, NVDEC, or
constructs a model, rather than discovering the overlap as an out-of-memory or
context-corruption fault later.

The lease is *advisory*, in the POSIX ``flock`` sense: it binds cooperating
processes in this repository and is released automatically when a holder dies.
It is not a driver-level reservation and makes no claim about processes outside
this repository.  Acquire it before any accelerator construction and release it
on clean exit.

The lock file inode is deliberately never unlinked.  Deleting it would let a
second process create a fresh inode and take an independent lock on it while the
first holder still owns the old one — the classic advisory-lock defeat.  A
leftover unlocked file is harmless and is reused by the next process.
