    """Rasterize a bed polygon into a binary mask, local to its own AABB.

    Why rasterization and not exact analytic clipping: production polygons
    on this site are confirmed non-convex (17-26 of 48 vertices reflex, per
    live measurement) and one persisted camera's trace self-intersects at
    its closing seam (a ~2.2px trace-closure artifact, not a real
    self-crossing shape). A convex-only clip (e.g. Sutherland-Hodgman) is
    silently wrong for the non-convex majority; a general polygon-clipping
    algorithm correct for both non-convexity and self-intersection
    (Weiler-Atherton and friends) is a subtle-bug factory nobody here could
    review with confidence. `cv2.fillPoly`'s scanline rasterizer handles
    both cases correctly with no special-casing, using a dependency this
    project already has (`opencv-python-headless`) -- adding an exact
    polygon-intersection library (e.g. shapely) was judged not worth a new
    dependency for this alone.

    Deliberately permissive: a polygon that self-intersects still gets
    rasterized (a sane filled region, just not what shoelace-style analytic
    area would call "valid") -- it is NOT rejected into the AABB fallback.
    Silently reverting an already-broken camera back to the AABB path while
    everything else (PR, tests, dashboard) reports the bug fixed is a worse
    failure than an ambiguous few pixels at a seam. Only genuinely unusable
    input falls back here: fewer than 3 points, all points collinear, or an
    empty mask after fill -- each logged once (this function is cached, so
    the warning does not repeat every frame) so a fallback is never silent.

    Cached (`lru_cache`) because polygons are static per camera between
    bed-zone re-recognitions; this runs per person per bed per frame at
    5fps, and re-rasterizing on every call would be wasted, repeated work.
