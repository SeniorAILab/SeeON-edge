# FEATURE SLICES

Vertical cut: one capability, one package. Router and store live together.
Sibling `*_router.py` files stay in that package. `create_app` is the only mounter.
## Layout

Router modules export `router` in `__all__`. Never `include_router` a sibling slice here.
Owner constructs (`from_env()` or lifespan) and exposes a getter that
writes `app.state` once. Dependents call the getter. They never
`from_env()` a second copy of someone else's store.
Lifespan pre-builds `camera_registry`, in-memory `heartbeat_store`,
`runtime_status_store`, and (when `ML_API_EXECUTION_RECORDS_ENABLED`)
`execution_record_store`. Clip listing is compact-authority on request. Other
stores may lazy-open so `no_lifespan` tests still boot. Relay commits each
alert to PostgreSQL before any Hub push. With no Hub mapping or no ingest
client the alert stays local and gets a local receipt.
## Cross-slice graph

Read or call. Do not construct the other slice's store.
- `audit` owns `AuditStore`. Governed mutations in any slice append through
  `audit.http.append_transactional` / `append_governed` with an `AuditAction` from `backend.app.shared.audit_values`.
- `relay` consumes cameras (`worker_config_snapshot`, registry), clips
  catalog, and status stores. No store of its own.
- `diagnostics` owns `execution_record_store` and the engineer query
  `GET /diagnostics/executions`. Worker ingest is `POST /relay/execution-records`
  on the diagnostics router, which passes its own body cap to
  `shared/http/relay_http.bounded_body_route`.
- `evidence` reuses `shared/http/relay_http` (`authorize_relay`, `camera_binding`), clip-dir constants,
  and the runtime-settings export gate. Worker ingest stays under `/relay`.
  Operator incidents are the second router in this same slice.
- `cameras` merges detection, connection, clip storage location, runtime
  settings, and heartbeat age. `worker_config_snapshot` is the only place
  local detection overrides meet pulled config.
- `connection` drives cameras roster/topology helpers and heartbeat-relay
  state. After enroll it calls `lifespan.apply_connection_settings` and
  `refresh_backend_config`. That callback is the approved lifespan import.
- `status` reads the cameras expected set and runtime settings. `/status`
  merges heartbeat plus runtime snapshot. `/system` is disk and image
  metadata, not camera liveness.
- `detection_settings` reads cameras (Hub id only) and connection. It never
  writes `app.state.pulled_config`.
- `streams` lives in cameras. It proxies worker MJPEG and duplicates the
  relay header constant so it does not import cameras-router privates.
Hard edges: no `backend.app.main` imports. Only connection imports `lifespan`.
No `qa/` package exists (retired); nothing imports one.
## HTTP, stores, tests

Parent locks BaseModel shape. Schemas sit next to the router or in slice
`schemas.py`. No package-wide `models.py`. Query objects are frozen models
via `Annotated[..., Query()]`. Optimistic writes carry `expected_version`
and return 409 with the current row. Dashboard routes call
`authorize_dashboard`. Worker routes call `shared/http/relay_http.authorize_relay`.
Shared HTTP helpers live in `backend/app/shared/http/`; do not borrow them
from another slice's router. Body caps come from
`bounded_body_route(limits)`; each router passes its own suffix table.
A route that serves bytes registers `methods=HEAD_METHODS` (`shared/http/head_response.py`) -- FastAPI never synthesises HEAD from GET, so a
bare `@router.get` 404s the probe a player sends before it opens the media.
One endpoint serves both methods so headers cannot drift; drop the body last
with `drop_body_for_head`, and never read a file a HEAD will not send.
API actor writes the compact application tables and the six `execution_*`
record tables. Never INSERT retired
`control_*`, `qa_*`, `runtime_*`, `evidence_*`, or `derivative_*` families.
Dashboard sessions are in memory (`shared/http/dashboard_auth.py`), not in
the database. Incomplete enrollment deletes ingest and evidence
attrs and sets `backend_configured=False`. Handlers do not
build `EdgeIngestClient`. Drive the slice through
`create_app(lifespan=no_lifespan)` plus an injected store, or full lifespan
when listing or refresh is the subject. Slice tests: `tests/test_api_*.py`,
`tests/test_connection_*.py`, `tests/test_clip_listing_*.py`, `tests/test_audit_*.py`. New
`features.*` import: `uv run --group lint lint-imports`.
## Anti-patterns

New product verb in `routes/` (probes and compat GETs only). Second
top-level folder for the same capability. Operator UX growing inside
`relay/router.py` (belongs in `evidence/operator_router.py`). Emitting a
local registry id on a Hub-bound payload. Worker-config keeps unmapped cameras
and uses `backend_camera_id` or the local id so ingestion never stops. Raw path joins into the clip store (use
`clips/descriptor_files.py` or evidence `_verified_media`, O_NOFOLLOW).
Teaching retired QA HTTP from `create_app`. Polling `edge.sqlite3` for worker progress; HTTP relay is the signal.
